 ## Mako can find this base file because it's in the settings.py -> MAKO_TEMPLATES_DIRS list
<%inherit file="base_dash.htm" />


## This is the base page for both the dashboards. Sprouting off of this one will be a manager and an admin page with minute
## differences. What should be on this dashboard template should be included on both pages. Content and left side for this. 

## what can both do?: view/edit personal profile information; view users; view store information; check inventory (will lead to Em's sites); 
## what can an admin do additionally?: edit users; update store information; create store information; 

##Need to figure out how to make this visibl on the .js or bootstrap file.
